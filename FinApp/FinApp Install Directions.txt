1)Clone Repo to local machine
- "Git Clone https://github.com/AaDGarrison/CSC4022-TuringTribe.git"

2)Python Virtual Enviroment setup
- Go into CSC4022-TuringTribe\FinApp Directory and create Folder called "PythonEnviroment"
- Open CMD and Navigate to FinApp directory of Repo "CSC4022-TuringTribe\FinApp"
- Run "python -m venv ./PythonEnviroment"    May need to change python to python3
- Activate your vurtial enviroment ".\PythonEnviroment\Scripts\activate"
	-should see Python Envroment come up in the bottom left
	- Run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
- Open VsCode, open folder CSC4022-TuringTribe\FinApp
	- shift+ctrl+P Select interpretor and select the python.exe that is in the PythonEnviroment Directory
		- This should stay active for all future times opening visual studio code
		- I recommend downloading Python Enviroment manager since you can see all local venv as well(Might need to change securty Policies)
- create Text file and name it ".gitignore" in the "CSC4022-TuringTribe\" directory (Might be already added)
	- add "/FinApp/PythonEnviroment" to file. Save and Close

3) Running Application from Vscode
-open visual studio code 
-open FinApp Foder
-open manage.py
-Run Python

4)Adding a dependency:
- Go into CSC4022-TuringTribe\FinApp Directory
- Activate your virtual enviroment ".\PythonEnviroment\Scripts\activate"
- "pip install "dependency""
- "pip freeze > requirements.txt"
- git commit changes to requirements.txt for everyone else
- git push

5) Run Django Test
- using CMD go into CSC4022-TuringTribe\FinApp directory
- Activate your vurtial enviroment ".\PythonEnviroment\Scripts\activate"
- run python manage.py runserver
- Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and verify that a Django page has opened
