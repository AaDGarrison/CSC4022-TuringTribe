1)Clone Repo to local machine
- "Git Clone https://github.com/AaDGarrison/CSC4022-TuringTribe.git"

2)Python Virtual Envirment
- Go into CSC4022-TuringTribe\FinApp Directory and create Folder called "PythonEnviroment"
- Open CMD and Navigate to FinApp directory of Repo "CSC4022-TuringTribe\FinApp"
- Run "python -m venv ./PythonEnviroment"    May need to change python to python3
- Activate your vurtial enviroment ".\PythonEnviroment\Scripts\activate"
	-should see Python Envroment come up in the bottom left
	- Run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
- Open VsCode, open folder CSC4022-TuringTribe\FinApp
	- shift+ctrl+P Select interpretor and select the python.exe that is in the PythonEnvirment Directory
		- This should stay active for all future times opening visual studio code
		- I recommend downloading Python Enviroment manager since you can see all local venv as well(Might need to change securty Policies)
- create Text file and name it ".gitignore" in the "CSC4022-TuringTribe\" directory (Might already added)

3) Running Application from Vscode
