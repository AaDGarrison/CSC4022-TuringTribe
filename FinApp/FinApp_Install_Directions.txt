1) Clone Repo to local machine
- "Git Clone https://github.com/AaDGarrison/CSC4022-TuringTribe.git"

2) Python Virtual Enviroment setup
	- Go into CSC4022-TuringTribe\FinApp Directory and create Folder called "PythonEnvirnoment"
	- Open CMD and Navigate to FinApp directory of Repo "CSC4022-TuringTribe\FinApp"
	- Run "python -m venv ./PythonEnvironment"    May need to change python to python3
	- Activate your vurtial enviroment ".\PythonEnvironment\Scripts\activate"
		-should see Python Environment come up in the bottom left
		- Run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
	- Open VsCode, open folder CSC4022-TuringTribe\FinApp
		- shift+ctrl+P Select interpretor and select the python.exe that is in the PythonEnviroment Directory
			- This should stay active for all future times opening visual studio code
			- I recommend downloading Python Enviroment manager since you can see all local venv as well(Might need to change securty Policies)
	- create Text file and name it ".gitignore" in the "CSC4022-TuringTribe\" directory (Might be already added)
		- Add "/FinApp/PythonEnviroment" to file. Save and Close.

3) Running Application from Vscode
	- Open visual studio code 
	- Open FinApp Folder
	- Open manage.py
	- Run Python

4) Adding a dependency:
	- Go into CSC4022-TuringTribe\FinApp Directory
	- Activate your virtual enviroment ".\PythonEnviroment\Scripts\activate"
	- "pip install "dependency""
	- "pip freeze > requirements.txt"
	- git commit changes to requirements.txt for everyone else
	- git push

5) Run Django Test
	- Using CMD go into CSC4022-TuringTribe\FinApp directory
	- Activate your vurtial enviroment ".\PythonEnviroment\Scripts\activate"
	- Run python manage.py runserver
	- Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/ and verify that a Django page has opened
